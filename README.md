Fire TV Stick 4K (2nd gen.) fails on some videos that play well on other Android platforms.

These are some video samples that do not play correctly on Fire TV Stick 4K (2nd gen.).
I try to keep them under 10 seconds.

This one results in a completely black screen, not even the OSD is displayed.
It plays well on:
- Pixel 7 Pro phone (Android 14): VLC, MX Player, Kodi
- TV LG OLED48CX3LB (WebOS updated to sept 2024): Kodi, Plex (no transcoding), Jellyfin (no transcoding), Stremio

On TIMVISION Box Sagemcom DTIW3930 there is no audio output irrespective of player.
